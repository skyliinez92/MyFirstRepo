- 👋 Hi, I’m @skyliinez92. I've worked in the IT industry for 9 years now as a Sysadmin and Infrastructure Engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in the world of Cloud and DevOps. I have taken various training courses and exams to get to where I am today, including the MCSE and Azure Administrator Associate.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux (mainly RHEL) to adapt my sysadmin skills to the Linux OS and use that knowledge as a baseline, as I move through various training steps towards becoming a DevOps engineer. Next on my study path is my RHCSA and Azure Solutions Architect. Once I complete these, I will move onto more scripting and DevOps focused tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PowerShell and Python scripts, ARM templates, and eventually Ansible and Terraform.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord @ skyliinez92#7824.
